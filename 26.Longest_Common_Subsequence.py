Problem (leetcode: 1143)

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.\

Example 2:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

Example 3:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        dp = [[0 for i in range(len(text2) + 1)] for j in range(len(text1) + 1)]
        
        text1 = " " + text1
        text2 = " " + text2
        
        for i in range(1, len(text1)):
            for j in range(1, len(text2)):
                if text1[i] == text2[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
            
        return dp[-1][-1]
